<title> ROSCoq VM Installation </title>
</head>

<body>

  
<p>
We have created a VirtualBox VM
with Coq, ROSCoq's Coq development, ROS, 
ROSJava and the ROSCoq shim preinstalled.
It has been created
by following the above instructions on a fresh install of 
<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/contribute/?version=14.04.2&architecture=amd64">Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS</a>
</p>
However, you might encounter USB hardware issues while using this VM.
The key issue is that the iCreate robot will (obviously) be 
physically connected to a USB port of the host of the VM and needs to somehow
be passed through to the Guest (VM).
There are known issues in USB pass through mechanisms of VirtualBox.
<br>
We had success with an Ubuntu (14.04) host, but not a Windows (8.1) host
with only USB 3.0 ports.
Try plugging your iCreate to a USB 2.0 port on the host.
Also, the image has been created and tested with VirtualBox version 4.3.26.
It might be a good idea to use the same or higher version of VirtualBox.

<br>
If you plan to use this VM image, you can skip all the above instructions
and follow the ones below:

  <ol>
    <li>Install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>.  </li>
    <li>Download the VM Image (coming soon). We are trying to find out how to distribute the VM image
      which is <em>3.1GB</em> in size. </li>
    <li>Import this .ova file in VirtualBox by clicking at File | Import Appliance. 
         In this process, VirtualBox will let you change the RAM and number of CPU's 
          allocated to the VM. It is recommended that you change these values
          if they are respectively greater than what is available in your host machine.
    </li>
    <li>Set up USB pass through : Go to USB settings of the imported VM and check "Enable USB 2.0 (EHCI) Controller". 
        On a linux host, there is an additional step of adding your account to the 
        <code>vboxusers</code> group :
        <br>
        <br>
        <code> abhishek@abhishek-desktop:~$ sudo usermod -G vboxusers -a $USER</code>
        <br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        Start the Virtual Machine. Login with password "abcd".
    </li>
    <li>Connect the iCreate to the computer (host of the VM) and click on Devices | USB Devices | FTDI ... 
        to get the iCreate device passed through to the guest (VM). After this, 
         <code>ls /dev/ttyUSB*</code> on the guest should return  <code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code>.
    </li>
  </ol>
