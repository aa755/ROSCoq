  <h3>
    Instructions for installing <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/indigo"> 
      ROS Indigo  </a> and the ROS drivers for iRobot
      <a href="http://www.irobot.com/About-iRobot/STEM/Create-2.aspx"> Create</a>
  </h3>
  <ol> 
    <li> Download our <a href="rosInstall.sh">script</a>.
        This script can be used to install ROS and iRobot Create drivers.
      <br>
      <br>
      <code> abhishek@abhishek-desktop:~$ wget www.cs.cornell.edu/~aa755/ROSCoq/rosInstall.sh</code>
      <br>
      <br>
      It assumes that the iCreate device is commected to the computer
      at the port <code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code> . On your machine, it might be 
      <code>/dev/ttyUSB1</code> or <code>/dev/ttyUSB2</code> ...
      (especially if you have multiple USB devices connected).
      One way to find out is to see the difference between the output
      of <code>ls /dev/ttyUSB*</code> before and after connecting
      the iRobot Create via USB.
      If needed, replace the two occurrences of <code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code>
      in the downloaded script.
    </li>
    <li>
      Now run the script. The script uses <code>apt-get</code> 
      will prompt for permission to
      download packages. Make sure the robot is connected
      before executing the script, because it sets the appropriate
      permissions for the USB device.
      <br>
      <br>
      <code> abhishek@abhishek-desktop:~$ bash -x rosInstall.sh</code>
      <br>
      <br>
      
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>
    <a name="test">Testing the Robot setup</a>
  </h3>
  After the above and before installing the Shim, it is important
  to check that the robot, its drivers and ROS are working properly.
  This is a 3 step process
  <ol>
    <li> Start <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/roscore">roscore</a> as follows:
      <br>
      <br>
      <code> abhishek@abhishek-desktop:~$ source ~/.bashrc</code>
      <code> abhishek@abhishek-desktop:~$ roscore</code>
      <br>
      <br>
        Wait a few seconds so that the output settles down.
    </li>
    
    <li> In a <em>new terminal</em>, start the ROS driver (node) representing the
        icreate robot:
      <br>
      <br>
      <code> abhishek@abhishek-desktop:~$ roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch</code>
      <br>
      <br>
        Wait a few seconds so that the output settles down.
    </li>
    
    <li> In a <em>new terminal</em>, send a message to the above node
         to move forward at 0.1 metres per second.
      <br>
      <br>
      <code> abhishek@abhishek-desktop:~$ rostopic pub -1 /cmd_vel_mux/input/navi geometry_msgs/Twist '[0.1, 0, 0]' '[0, 0, 0]'</code>
      <br>
      <br>
        The robot will move only for a fraction of a second. 
        In contrast to the 
          <a href="http://pharos.ece.utexas.edu/wiki/index.php/Writing_A_Simple_Node_that_Moves_the_iRobot_Create_Robot#Talking_on_Topic_cmd_vel">old drivers</a>
          where the robot keeps following the last command indefinately, 
          the new drivers stops the robot 
          if no new message was received within 100 milliseconds.
          So we have written our own driver which provides the old interface
          by repeatedly sending the last message at 10 Hz to the new driver.
          While running our Coq programs, we will use that driver instead,
            because our axiomatization is currently based on the old driver.
    </li>

  </ol>
  
<!--so that one can easily run Coq programs on their 
      iRobot <a href="http://www.irobot.com/For-the-Home/Vacuum-Cleaning/Roomba.aspx"> Roomba</a> 
      or <a href="http://www.irobot.com/About-iRobot/STEM/Create-2.aspx"> Create</a>
-->
