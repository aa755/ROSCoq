(** In [sidewaysMove], we analyzed the space needed to execute
a sideways move, which is specified by 3 parameters.
To implement such a move, one has to invert that equation --
given the amount of available space, find a best
choice of those 3 parameters.
We fix one of those by deciding that while turning, the
steering wheel will be at its extremities -- this choice
may be optimal.

2 parameters remain : how much to drive while turning,
and how much to drive while moving straight.
The total X-space needed can be decomposed as a sum
of 2 terms, each of which is a function of these 2 parameters. 
The latter function, which
is the X-space consumed by the straight move, is easily
invertible. The former, which is
the space needed to execute the [Wriggle] part of the sideways move,
is a horrendous quartic -- will be solved numerically, and only approximately.
(It may be possible to solve it exatly.)

There is a meta parameter [k] denoting what fraction of the available
X-space is spent on doing Wriggle. The upward shift (the larger, the better) 
is 0 for both extremes of this paremeter (0 and 1).
If wriggle is done without consuming any extra space, no turn will
be produced, and hence the straight move in the middle will result
in  0 upward shift. On the other hand, if all the space 
is spent on wriggle, the
car will turn a lot, but return to its original position
 (Wriggle + WriggleInv == 0).
We will try many choices of this [k], and pick the best among those.

The proof only says that the sideways move will be safe, and
produce a positive upward shift. Depending on how carefully the
parameter [k] is chosen, a possibly approximate optimality theorem
may be proven.

(** Recap:
[extraSpaceX1W] is valid only for 
when [(α * d)] is  between 0 and [leftCriticalAngle].
There is also an [extraSpaceX2] for the case when
[(α * d)] is between [leftCriticalAngle]
and [(polarTheta βPlusBack)/2], however that 
range may be so small for most cars, that 
it is not worth analysing that equation.
For mazda 3, the range was 2 degrees.
Beyond [(polarTheta βPlusBack)/2], the problem
becomes trivial, and can be solved in just 1 move.
